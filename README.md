# dia
Dia is an AI and command line interface trained on an API. She can interact with the user and recognize commands that translate into macros that the CLI can use to complete tasks such as connecting to other machines and moving files. This Open Source project showcases a thesis in Deep Learning, and AI to interface experimentation.
