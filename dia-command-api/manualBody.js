        this command is called 'example_cmd'. It has both a short 
        and long option description. you can put a multiple things
        in a command input including the command name, parameters, 
        flags, and assignments.
        
        details:

            ${B} '-exa' is the shortened name for the command, 
            abbreviated and preffixed by a dash '-' symbol.

            ${B} parameters are emphasized by brackets in usage
            syntax. like so [parameter].

            ${B} '-Flags' are used inside commands as option identifiers,
            and externally as macro flags which start with a dollar sign '$'

            ${B} 'assignments: ...' are keywords that store any information, 
            including macros. you can pass keywords to macros as function parameters and get 
            information out which you can store in another macro.

                -> result: operateOn({keyword}, '[parameter one] $Flag')
                -> result | echo

            you can make assignments anywhere and they will be stored global scope.
            the delimiter for making local assignments specific to the scope
            of a command is '^'. you can create a copy of a global keyword and
            use it in the local scope of the command by denoting it with '^'. 
            this helps with dealing with commands or macros that are impure.
            (meaning the value going into a function is different when it exits)

                -> one: 1;
                -> result: add(^result, one) /* 
                    safe add and increment
                    reassignment. system may implement multithreading 
                    in the future so this makes things safer.
